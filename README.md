# Sybil-attack-detection
This project aims to detect and mitigate Sybil attacks in P2P networks by combining trust-based systems and behavior analysis. A simulated P2P network under attack will test the lightweight detection mechanism, evaluating accuracy and overhead. The project enhances security and trust in decentralized systems like VoIP, blockchain, and file sharing.
